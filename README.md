Just a JIT toy,for me to play with SLJIT library.

A simple integer calculator using JIT . JIT library is stakless jit. It includes the source code inside of the package.  Only integer supports and operation are add,substract,multiply and divide. Also variable is support . 

Usage : calc -e 1+2\*3+(4/a)+2 -v a=15

This example will calculate the expression with variable a has value 15

Craft it in about 2 hours, no too much test done. 

Have fun :)
